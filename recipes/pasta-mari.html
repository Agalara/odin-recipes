                <li><strong>20g</strong> butter</li>
                <li><strong>2</strong> garlic cloves</li>
                <li><strong>4 spoons</strong> of olive oil</li>
                <li><strong>2 teaspoons</strong> of fresh parsley for decoration</li>
                <li><strong>1,5l</strong> of water</li>
                <li><strong>A pinch </strong> of nutmeg </li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Pepper</strong> <em>(freshly grinded if possible)</em></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Let's start preparing our recipe by boiling <strong>1,5l</strong> of water in a medium sized pot.
                We will prepare the rest of the ingredients while the water starts to boil. Once the water is boiling, add <strong>
                    250g</strong> of your favourite pasta and a pinch of salt. Check after 5 to 7 minutes to see if it's cooked. </li>
                <li>In one pan, we will add <strong>20g</strong> of butter and both garlic cloves pressed. Then set the temperature
                to a medium heat. Once the garlic looks brownish, it will be ready  for the next step.</li>
                <li>When the garlic looks ready, add <strong>200ml</strong> of cream to it, and set the temperature to low.</li>
                <li>In a different pan, we'll add <strong>2 spoons</strong> of olive oil and set the temperature to high. Grill the
                 <strong>100g</strong> of prawns in this pan while the garlic is being grilled too. </li>
                <li>Once the praws are <em>sligthly</em> grilled, move them to the pan with the garlic and the cream to let
                them finish cooking in the cream. The cream will also reduce and get thicker.</li>
                <li>In the pan where we grilled the prawns, add <em>(if necessary)</em> another <strong>2 teaspoons</strong> of 
                olive oil and set the temperature to medium. Once it's warm enough, put the salmon in the pan and grill it. It will 
                need about <em>6-8 minutes</em> per side, depending on the thickness.</li>
                <li>At this poin, the pasta should be ready and stirred out of water.</li>
                <li>When the salmon is cooked, cut it into dices about the size of a bite and move it into the cream sauce.</li>
                <li>Add <strong>Salt,Pepper</strong> and <strong>nutmeg</strong> to the cream sauce.</li>
                <li>And finally, if the pasta is cold, you can warm it up in the pan where you  grilled the salmon, adding a bit
                    of butter  if neccesary.</li>
                <li>Put the pasta on a dish, add the sauce on top and decorate it adding <strong>1 teaspoon </strong>of 
                parsley.</li>
            </ol>
