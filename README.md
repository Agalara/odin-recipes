# odin-recipes
Contains the files for the Recipe Project#1

This will be my first project as a part of the Odin Project.
It will consist in a very basic designed website containing a couple of recipes.

The pourpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic knowledge  of HTML,
since it will include the elements learnt in the foundations chapter:

-The broiler plate.
-Index.html as the main site.
-Different html documents containing the recipes.
-Links interconnecting them.
-Links to different images.
-Providing some format to the text.
-The use of Git and Github as CVS.




Disclaimer:
Since this is just for learning pourposes, some jokes or irony could be encountered.
