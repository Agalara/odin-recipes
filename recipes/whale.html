        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Add <strong>Walnuts,Almonds,Sweet apples,Carrots,Raisins,Butter,Pepper and Salt</strong> in two concrete
                mixer trucks and mix everything until we obtain an uniform paste.</li>
                <li>Cut open the <strong>Whale</strong> and eviscerate it. Once it's done, rinse the carcass with clean water and repeat the process
                    until only clean water is coming out. It's strongly recommended to wear a raincoat,gloves and rubber boots during the process.</li>
                <li>Preheat up to 120Â°C an industrial oven. The nearest steal mill should have one with enough capacity.</li>
                <li>Fill the <strong>Whale</strong> with the mix contained in both cement mixers and close it.</li>
                <li>Load the <strong>Whale</strong> with an up to <em>7 tonnes</em> crane on a flat bed  trailer and transport to
                the oven.</li>
                <li>The process of baking will take about <em>16 to 18 hours</em>. In the meantime, peel off the potatoes and cut them
                    into smaller pieces. Mix them with <strong>Olive oil, thyme,rosmarin and salt </strong> and put them in the oven the last
                    2 and a half hours.</li>

                <li>Once the potatoes are soft, it's time to serve. Sea chanties are reccomended to be sang to make this 
                    an unforgetable dinner.</li>
